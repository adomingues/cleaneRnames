My first R package

Installed usethis to automate some of the task.

```{r include=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("r-lib/usethis")
library(usethis)
setwd("/home/adomingu/sandbox")
pkg_dir <- file.path(".", "cleaneRnames")
create_package(pkg_dir)
```

I choose the license "MIT" because straitgth and to the point.

```{r}
use_mit_license("AntÃ³nio Domingues")
```

Then in Rstudio I just opened the project created by `usethis`.

Importantly I need some code for it. 

```{r }
use_readme_md()
```
